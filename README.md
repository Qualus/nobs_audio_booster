# nobs_audio_booster
This is a quick and dirty audio booster for android devices.
Just in case you need to have a louder audio without using an app with 3000 ads and useless premium features.




## Getting Started
Connect your android device in Dev mode to a machine with Flutter installed. Go to the root folder via terminal and run
flutter install


That's it :)

## Should I install a software from a random guy?

Not really,but the code is public and you can check what it does.
